## ✨ Why Windows 95?

Windows 95 represents a pivotal moment in computing history. It was the first Windows version that truly brought personal computing to the masses. The iconic Start menu, taskbar, and window controls set a standard that influences UI design to this day.

As a problem solver working in modern tech, I find inspiration in Windows 95's balance of functionality and simplicity. The OS managed to be approachable to complete novices while still being powerful enough for serious work - a design principle I strive to follow in my own projects.
